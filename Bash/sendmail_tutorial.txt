1) Install ssmtp

sudo apt install ssmtp

2) Use the editor of your choice to edit the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf file and add the following lines

mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
AuthPass=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TLS_CA_File=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Insert your gmail address in the AuthUser entry and your password in the AuthPass entry

3a) You can then send an email to a receiver with the following command

echo -e "Subject: Type the subject here\n\ntype the contents of the message here" | sendmail receiver@domain.com

(running "sendmail receiver@domain.com" and typing EOF into the terminal will also work, sending a blank message to the receiver)

3b) You can also send a file with the subject and contents of the message. Let's say you create a "test.txt" file as such:

''''''
Subject: This is Subject Line

Email content line 1
Email content line 2
''''''

Then simply run

ssmtp receiver@domain.com < /path/msg.txt
